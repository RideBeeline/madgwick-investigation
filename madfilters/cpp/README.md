# C / Cpp based filter

The original filter, downloaded from the [x-io website](https://x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/) and unpacked into `./madgwick_originals/MadgwickAHRS`.

Endings changed to .cpp for easier Cython integration.

## Installation

You have to be in the `cpp` directory before running `setup.py`. Like so:

```
cd madfilters/cpp
python setup.py
```
